## The Autokeyer is an arduino based system that will allow the user to select a plain text file of hexidecimal characters delimited by space and allowed to upload onto the EF4 data bus. The firmware is included within this project.

The 4 buttons consist of Back, Up, Down and Program
### Back
This button has two functions, 1 - Back up directory, 2 - Stop loading if the file is loading.
### Up and Down
Traverse up and down the SD file list
### Program
Select program to be uploaded

When code is being uploaded the small OLED screen will display address and data being transferred and the EFA-4 Address and Data LEDS will display in sync
