# EFA-datorn-EFA-4-Computer
The EFA-datorn (EFA Computer) is a simple, educational microcomputer featured in Elektronik för alla, del 4: En mikrodator i "slow motion", a Swedish electronics book published in 1983 by Berndt Andersson and Lars Asplund. Designed as a hands-on learning tool for beginners.

## Overview
•	Purpose: The EFA-datorn is a low-cost, deliberately slow-running microcomputer created for educational purposes, allowing users to observe and understand the basic operations of a computer’s hardware and software in real time.

•	Context: Introduced in part 4 of the Elektronik för alla series, it bridges digital electronics and computer technology, building on concepts from part 3 (digital techniques) and complementing later parts (7 and 8).

•	Target Audience: Hobbyists, students, and beginners in electronics and computing, with no advanced math or physics prerequisites.

## Key Features

•	Simplified Design: 

o	The EFA-datorn is a minimal microcomputer with basic components, including a RCA CDP1802 processor, 128 byte memory, and input/output systems via toggle switches.

o	Designed to be built with affordable, widely available electronic components, making it accessible for home assembly.

•	Slow Operation: 

o	The computer operates at a reduced speed, described as "slow motion," allowing users to manually step through processes like instruction execution, data transfer, and memory access.

o	This slow pace enables learners to observe how a CPU fetches, decodes, and executes instructions, making abstract concepts tangible without requiring advanced tools like oscilloscopes.

•	Input/Output: 

o	Includes basic I/O interfaces, such as switches or a simple keypad for input and LEDs or a small display for output, typical for educational microcomputers of the era.

•	Programming: 

o	Supports simple programming, in assembly 1802 language, to teach how software controls hardware.

o	Programs are entered via the 8 toggle switches into the computer’s memory.

•	Processor: RCA CDP1802 8-bit microprocessor.

•	Memory: 128 bytes of ram expandable to 2K or 8K via daughter cards.

•	Power Supply: Likely powered by a low-voltage DC source, suitable for safe home use.
